# evolutionary_strategies
This repository provides an <b>unofficial</b> implementation of the evolutionary strategies optimizer by Beyer and Schwefel 2002<sup>1</sup>.
Evolutionary optimization is an optimization technique inspired by natural selection.
Most optimization techniques rely on analytical or numerical computations of function derivatives. Thus they are limited to smooth or at least continous functions. Gradient based methods usually also require convexity. With evolutionary algorithms even non-convex and discrete functions can be optimized.
