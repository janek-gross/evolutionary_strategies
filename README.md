# evolutionary_strategies
This repository provides an <b>unofficial</b> implementation of the evolutionary strategies optimizer by ???.
Evolutionary optimization is an optimization technique inspired by natural selection.
Most optimization techniques rely on analytical or numerical computations of function derivatives. Thus they are limited to smooth or at least continous functions. With evolutionary algorithms even discrete functions can be optimized.


## Requirements
- [x] `Python 3`
- [x] `Numpy`

## Usage
The examples.ipynb jupiter-notebook demonstrates the basic functionality of the evolutionary strategies optimizer.
